        <h1> Early Life </h1>
        <p> Miller was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, to American parents.[2] His mother, Roxann (née Palm), is a special education teacher, and his father, Wentworth E. Miller II, is a lawyer and teacher, who was studying at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship at the time of Miller's birth.[1][3][4] Miller said in 2003 that his father is black and his mother is white.[5] His father is of African-American, Jamaican, German, and English ancestry; his mother is of Rusyn,[6] Swedish, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese ancestry.[7][8] He has two sisters, Leigh and Gillian.</p>

            Miller's family moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, when he was a year old.[4][9] He attended Midwood High School in Brooklyn, and graduated from Princeton University in 1995 with an BA in English after completing a 116-page long senior thesis, titled "Doubling and the Identity Construct in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 'The Yellow Wallpaper,' Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea, and Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre", under the supervision of Gina Dent.[10][11] While at Princeton, he performed with the a cappella group the Princeton Tigertones and was a member of the Quadrangle Club and the Colonial Club.

            In 1995, Miller relocated to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.[13] He has stated that his rocky road to stardom "was a long time in the coming and there were a lot of upsets and a lot of failures and roadblocks, but I couldn't walk away from it. I needed it like I needed air, it was just something I had to do."[14] Miller's first TV appearance was as student-turned-sea monster Gage Petronzi on Buffy the Vampire Slayer ("Go Fish", 1998).

            Miller's first starring role was in 2002 as the sensitive, introverted David Scott in ABC's mini-series Dinotopia. After appearing in a few minor television roles, he moved on to co-star in the 2003 film The Human Stain, playing the younger version of the Anthony Hopkins character, Coleman Silk. He identified strongly with the core dilemma of the movie, about a black man who chooses to "pass" as white. Miller worked extensively on the role, not only in researching Anthony Hopkins, but by embarking on a four-month regimen to accurately portray Silk as a boxer. Also in 2003, he had a minor role in the film Underworld, playing a doctor and friend of the character Michael Corvin.
